Ilya Petrov
============

I`m sofware developer and I like living this way. I beleave lots
of people already wrote tons of reasons why this job is so cool.


Skills
------

 * python
 * django (hate this one)
 * flask
 * GAE
 * linux kernel drivers
 * ARM
 * hardcore unix user

I like microframeworks, nosql, unix and thin fanless ARM notebooks.
You can hire me on position of web developer. As the code I write
works not only in my mind, I`m interested in system-level things,
like linux virtualisation, kernel-space and server software.

Maby I should say its more interesting to deploy code then just
write it, but getting hired as developer is much easer then
system administrator or unix guru.

Job experience
--------------

 * Mamba dating service, social apps (Sep 2011 till present)
 * IPark Ventures, experika.com api (Apr 2010 - Jun 2011)
 * Limonika.ru, game server development (Dec 2008 - Mar 2010)

Open Source
------------

Everything I know about programming is thanks to Open Source
and I`m giving it back. I`m the author and contributor
of Linux kernel ports to various ARM devices like EEEPad transformer,
Toshiba AC100 cloudbook and some old Motorola smarphones.

Working on so different projects gives me understanding of
some similarity of core concepts across all well-designed systems.

Life
-----

Despite we programmers say we live in that magic place called Internet,
I live in Odessa, Ukraine. I`m thinkig about moving to some
completely differnet place of the world, maby Thailand.
